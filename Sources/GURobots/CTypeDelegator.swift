/**
 *  `CTypeDelegator` provides a common interface for swift types that convert
 *  and provide the functionality of underlying C types.
 *
 *  In such a case, some functionality needs to be provided. The swift type
 *  must provide the ability to be converted to the underlying C type.
 *
 *  This protocol also requires that conforming types behave the same way
 *  when it comes to equality, hashing, encoding and decoding using the
 *  `Equatable`, `Hashable`, `Encodable` and `Decodable` protocols.
