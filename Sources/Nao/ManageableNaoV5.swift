/// A fully manageable nao type.
///
/// Generally it is advisable to use `NaoV5` instead of this type. You
/// should only use this type if you are simulating a nao with
/// an editor or simulator. This type will not allow you to retrieve the current
/// state of the sensors, the current field position of the robot, nor any
/// useful data about what the robot is seeing. Instead, this type allows you to
/// specify all of these things manually. This gives you complete control.
///
/// Note that by itself, this struct looks like it doesn't do much.
/// This is because, the entirety of its functionality is provided through
/// protocols and protocols extensions. Consider looking through these protocols
/// in order to understand all the functionality that this type provides.
